# **Lido Protocol Integration**

## **Overview**

Lido is a decentralized liquid staking protocol for Ethereum that allows users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity. By staking ETH through Lido, users receive **stETH**, a liquid staking token, which continues to earn staking rewards and can be used across DeFi platforms.

### **Main Features**

-   Stake ETH and receive stETH
-   Wrap stETH into wstETH (non-rebasing token)
-   Unwrap wstETH back to stETH
-   Request and claim ETH withdrawals
-   Track staking rewards and APR
-   Check stETH and wstETH balances
-   View total staked ETH in Lido

### **Supported Networks**

-   **Ethereum**

### **Tokens**

-   **stETH** – Liquid staking token representing staked ETH
-   **wstETH** – Wrapped stETH for use in DeFi protocols that require a non-rebasing token

### **Example Operations**
