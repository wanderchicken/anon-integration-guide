# **Lido Protocol - Liquid Staking for Ethereum**

## **Overview**

Lido is a decentralized liquid staking protocol for Ethereum that allows users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity. By staking ETH through Lido, users receive **stETH**, a liquid staking token, in return. stETH can be used across DeFi platforms while continuing to earn staking rewards.

## **What Lido Protocol Can Do for You**

- **Liquid Staking**: Stake ETH and receive stETH, a liquid staking token.
- **Withdrawals**: Unstake stETH to retrieve ETH, including accumulated rewards.
- **DeFi Compatibility**: Utilize stETH in DeFi protocols without waiting for Ethereum withdrawals.
- **Real-time Rewards**: Earn staking rewards that are reflected in your stETH balance.
- **Wrapped Staking**: Convert stETH to **wstETH**, a non-rebasing token for DeFi protocols.

## **Supported Networks**

- **Ethereum**: Stake ETH and receive stETH for liquidity and DeFi strategies.

## **Common Tasks**

### **Staking ETH**

- Stake ETH and receive stETH:
  - "Stake 1 ETH in Lido."
  - "Stake half of my ETH in Lido."
  - "Show my stETH balance."

### **Unstaking & Withdrawals**

- Unstake stETH to retrieve ETH:
  - "Unstake 2 stETH from Lido."
  - "Unstake all my stETH from Lido."
  - "Withdraw ETH from my stETH balance."

### **Wrapping & Unwrapping**

- Convert stETH to wstETH and back:
  - "Wrap 1 stETH into wstETH."
  - "Unwrap 2 wstETH back to stETH."

### **Checking Rewards & APR**

- Retrieve staking details and rewards:
  - "Check my staking rewards."
  - "Get my average APR in Lido."
  - "Calculate total rewards earned."
